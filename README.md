Rock VS Mine Prediction is a very easy to do project of Machine Learning.
I started my journey of ML by finishing this small project.
  1. first it import dependencies
  2. Collect data and process it (loading data to a pandas Dataframe)
  3. figure out the number of rows and colums
  4. describe static mesures of the data
  5. sepates data nad lebels
  6. training the Logistic Regression model with training data
  7. accurecy and training
  8. accurecy of test data
  9. Make a Predictive System
These are the steps of completing the project.
It was fun doing this project and i'm now more motivated to do such ML projects more.
